### STM32MP1 Embedded Linux breakout board RevC


#### Changes

- Changed ÂµSD Card connector footprint from Push-Pull Molex 104031-0811 to Push-Push Hirose DM3BT-DSF-PEJS.
- Changed Buck Converter TPS42402 to TPS563200. Due to availability reasons.
- Add pull-down resistors to 1.35V and 1.8V voltage rail LEDs. Ensures that they don't stay illuminated when no voltage rail is present.
- Added M2 mounting holes
- Removed USB Type C connector (was used for power only, needed space)
- Replaced power connector. USB Type B Micro connector in place of plastic barrel connector (fed up with metling the barrel connector with the hot air gun)
- Replaced TPS buck converter (1.35V output) with adjustable AZ1117 LDO. Lowers BOM costs.
- Added pin header for direct connection to UART4 (for USB-Serial TTY session)
- Changed L3 to sensible footprint (e.g. not 0201)
